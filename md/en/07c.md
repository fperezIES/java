In this document we are going to talk about the classes provided by Java to manage our file system. We will learn how to do some basic operations, such as:

* Check if a file exists or not, or check if it's a normal file or a directory
* Copy/Move/Delete files
* Move through the file system, from one folder to its parent folder, or list the complete list of files and folders of a given location.

### 1. File class

`File` class is the most basic (and ancient) class to deal with our filesystem. It also belongs to `java.io` package, and has some methods to:

* Create files
* Delete files
* List files/folders contained in a given folder
* Get the file size in bytes
* ...

For instance, this piece of code checks if a file exists in our system:

```java
if (! (new File("example.txt")).exists() ) 
{
    System.err.println("File example.txt not found");
}
else
{
    // File exists
}
```

This other piece of code lists all the files and folders of a given folder in the system. For every subfolder, it marks it as *DIR*, and for every file, it prints its size in KB.

```java
File location = new File("D:" + File.separatorChar + "Downloads");
File[] contents = location.listFiles();
for(File f: contents)
{
    System.out.print(f.getName());
    if (f.isDirectory())
        System.out.println (" (DIR)");
    else
        System.out.println (" " + (f.length() / 1024) + "KB");
}
```

Note that we can use `File.separatorChar` property from `File` class to represent the separator char of current operating system. This will be `\` in Windows, or `/` in Linux (although you can also use `/` in Windows systems).

### 2. Path and Paths

`Path` is an interface representing a path in the system (this is, a sequence of folders and subfolders pointing to a given location). It is a newer element in Java API, that belongs to `java.nio` package, and it provides some useful methods, such as:

* `startsWith` / `endsWith`: to check if current path starts or ends with a given subpath.
* `getParent`: to get parent folder of current path
* `getRoot`: to get initial, root folder of current path
* `iterator`: to explore every folder and subfolder of this path
* `toAbsolutePath`: to get the absolute path of current path (from the root point)
* ...

`Paths` class contains some static methods to deal with paths. It also belongs to `java.nio` package, and lets us, for instance, get a `Path` object from a given route:

```java
Path location = Paths.get("/home/user/myFolder");
System.out.println("Parent folder is " + location.getParent().toString());
```

### 3. Files class

`Files` class is also a newer class in the Java API (it belongs to `java.nio` package) with a list of static methods to deal with our filesystem:

* `readAllLines(Path)` reads all the lines of the file and returns them in a `List`
* `copy(Path, Path)` or `move(Path, Path)` copy a file specified in a `Path` object into a `Path` destination (they only copy or move files, not folders)
* `delete(Path)` deletes a file (not a folder)
* `createDirectory(Path)` creates a new directory specified by the given `Path`
* `exists(Path)` checks if a given path exists (similar to File's `exists` method, but without having to create an object for this).
* ...

This piece of code reads the whole contents of a text file in one single line, and then we can just explore the `List` returned:

```java
try
{
    List<String> data = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get("data/file.txt"));
    for(String line: data)
    {
        ...
    }
}
catch (IOException ex)
{
    ...
}
```
