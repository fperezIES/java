How could we manage a date in a Java program? We could, for instance, store day, month and year as separate integers, or the whole date as a string. However, it would be difficult to validate a date, or to substract dates, for instance. Hopefully, Java provides some classes to deal with dates.

### Using Date and Calendar classes

From the very first versions of Java language, we have two classes available to manage dates. These classes are `Date` and `Calendar`.

Regarding **Date** class, it has some methods and constructors to instantiate dates, but most of them are now deprecated. **Calendar** class replaces *Date* class when creating dates in Java:

```java
Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
cal.set(2021, 5, 4);
System.out.println(cal.getTime());
// Thu Jun 24 20:09:27 CEST 2021
```

As you can see, `getInstance` method from `Calendar` class lets us instantiate objects of this class, and `set` method lets us specify a concrete year, month (starting from 0) and day.

We can also create a full date including hour, minute and second. We can also use `set` method specifying the type of elemento (day, month, hour, minute...) that we are setting:

```java
Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
cal.set(Calendar.YEAR, 2021);
cal.set(Calendar.MONTH, Calendar.JUNE);
cal.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 24);
cal.set(Calendar.HOUR, 10);
cal.set(Calendar.AM_PM, Calendar.PM);
// Also: cal.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 22);
cal.set(Calendar.MINUTE, 36);
cal.set(Calendar.SECOND, 54);

System.out.println(cal.getTime());
// Thu Jun 24 22:36:54 CEST 2021

System.out.println(cal.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH) +
    "/" + (cal.get(Calendar.MONTH) + 1) + "/" +
    cal.get(Calendar.YEAR));
// 24/6/2021
```

We can also do some basic operations with *Calendar* objects:

```java
Calendar date1 = Calendar.getInstance();
date1.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 10);
System.out.println("In 10 days it will be " + 
    date1.getTime());

Calendar date2 = Calendar.getInstance();
date2.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, -10);
if (date2.before(date1))
    System.out.println("It's before");
```

However, using *Calendar* class has some drawbacks or restrictions: we can't easily format a date in an output, or get the difference between two dates, for instance. So we should better use some newer classes, as we will see in next documents.

> Create a program called **UserBirthday** that asks the user to enter his birth date (day, month and year separately), and then tell him if his birthday has already taken place this year or not.
