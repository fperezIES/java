## Functional programming

- Programming paradigm (a way of implementing programs)
- Declarative: we tell the program how things are, not the sequence of commands to solve the problem (*imperative*)

## Functional programming features

- **Referential transparency**: calling a function with the same arguments must produce always the same result
- **Data immutability**
- **Function composition**: the output of a function can be joined with the input of next one (functions are treated as data)
- **First order functions**: functions that are passed as parameters to another functions

    <h2>Example of side effects</h2>
    <p>This function gets different result every time we call it with parameter 1</p>
    <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>    
int externalValue = 1;
int aFunction(int param)
{
    externalValue++;
    return externalValue + param;
}        
    </code></pre>

## Functional languages

- **Pure**: they only work with functional paradigm
   - Haskell, Miranda
- **Hybrid**: they were conceived to be functional, but work with other paradigms as well
   - Scala, Clojure
- **Other**: many currently popular languages have incorporated some functional features
   - Java, C#, JavaScript, Python...

## Imperative example

Filter adult people from a *people* list

```java
List<Person> adultPeople = new ArrayList<>();
for (int i = 0; i < people.size(); i++) {
    if (people.get(i).getAge() >= 18)
        adultPeople.add(people.get(i));
}            
```
</script>

## Declarative example

Filter adult people from a *people* list

```java
List<Person> adultPeople = people.stream()
.filter(p -> p.getAge() >= 18)
.collect(Collectors.toList()); 
```

## Conclusions

- Functional programming is usually shorter and less error prone
- In Java, it is mainly focused on:
   - Implementing functional interfaces with lambda expressions
   - Managing collections through streams
