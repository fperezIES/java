## Static elements

- Static attributes are also called *class variables*
- Static methods are also called *class methods*
- They are common to all the objects of a class, and we don't need to instantiate any object to use them
   - Static attributes are shared variables among all the objects of a class
- If we want to use them, we just use the class name followed by the method name
   - Class name is not necessary if we are using them from within the same class

## Static elements

```java
public class MyClass 
{
    static int count = 0;

    ...
    public static void myMethod() 
    {
        ...
    }

    public void myOtherMethod() 
    {
        ...
    }
}

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        MyClass.myMethod();         // OK
        MyClass.myOtherMethod();    // ERROR
        
        MyClass mc = new MyClass();
        mc.myMethod();              // OK (but not necessary)
        mc.myOtherMethod();         // OK        
    }
}
```

## Restrictions for static methods

- Inside a static methods we can only use:
   - Other static methods or attributes
   - Parameters received
   - Objects created inside the static method
- We can't invoke external, non-static methods from a static method (unless we create an object to call this method from the object)

## Instance elements vs Class elements

- **Instance element**: we need to instantiate an object of this class in order to use this element
- **Class element**: we don't need to instantiate any object of this class (static elements)

## Final elements

- Elements that can't be modified
- *Final variables*: constants
- *Final methods*: can't be overriden
- *Final classes*: can't be inherited
